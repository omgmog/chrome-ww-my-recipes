chrome-ww-my-recipes
=========================

A simple extension for Chrome, made because my wife keeps complaining about the lack of ability to search your own recipes on the new Weight Watchers site.

The icon is usable from the toolbar whenever you're browsing pages on the `cmx.weightwatchers.co.uk` domain. You need to be logged in to Weight Watchers to be able to use the plugin.
